# Implementation progress

## Current status

- Active phase: Phase 4 — Adapter coverage
- Status: Phases 0–3 complete; H1 and H2 approved; Ashby and Greenhouse adapter groups passed;
  Lever is next
- Pending human checkpoint: none; H4 is conditional and has not been triggered
- No source is enabled. All 330 canonical companies remain in first-release accounting.

## Completed gates

- Repository instructions, design, implementation guide, phased plan, product decisions, and data
  provenance documentation read in full.
- Canonical seed validated: 330 rows, unique IDs/names/ranks, contiguous source order, and priority
  counts P1 96 / P2 106 / P3 128.
- Provenance workbook preserved and its documented SHA-256 checksum verified.
- Phase 0 runtime and tooling established on CPython 3.12 with locked `uv` dependencies.
- Ruff formatting/linting, strict mypy, pytest, smoke commands, ignore rules, and clean-install
  validation established.
- Phase 1 schemas, rolling ten-day recency contract, publication-date measurement contract, and
  approved search-profile examples completed.
- H1 approved on 2026-09-20. Generic engineering/data-science titles use the conditional
  description AI-work lane; `Singapore or Remote` accepts the unqualified remote option.
- Versioned company-source registry loader, adapter-specific parameter validation, complete seed
  reconciler, and disabled registry generator implemented.
- Automated source discovery processed every one of the 330 companies. All 280 Google-search seed
  hints received ranked search evidence and bounded corrective searches where needed.
- Read-only verification used truthful client identification, bounded responses, timeouts, and
  sanitized ignored diagnostics. It did not authenticate or bypass access controls.
- Explicit quality audit rejected third-party, wrong-region, homonym, single-job, and
  non-enumerating false positives.
- Hosted ATS fingerprinting detected 39 unambiguous embedded configurations without retaining page
  bodies. Citi and Arm remained search-only because multiple boards were detected.
- An Adobe-supplied public page exposed a false-positive access classification: dormant CAPTCHA
  configuration in page scripts had been treated as an active challenge. Regression tests now
  distinguish visible challenge pages from script configuration, and all 44 affected sources were
  re-probed successfully with public HTTP 200 responses.
- Phase 3 added a bounded shared HTTP client, adapter runtime interface, fixture-backed Ashby
  parser, and a read-only source-verification command.
- Representative Ashby validation covered valid empty, small, large, and previously oversized
  boards. It found and corrected the case-sensitive Cerebras board name and WisdomAI's current
  hyphenated slug before the full-group run.
- Clipboard Health's former Greenhouse board returned 404. Its official careers page now links to
  the public Ashby `clipboard` board, so it was deterministically remapped and both affected
  adapter cohorts were revalidated.
- Updated full Ashby validation passed 25/25 companies: 24 successful boards, one valid empty
  board, 1,027 observed jobs, zero missing required fields, and 1,027 jobs with `published` date
  evidence. H3 was not triggered because the documented public API established completeness and
  direct links.
- Phase 4 Greenhouse fixtures and adapter cover healthy, empty, malformed, incomplete, duplicate,
  and blocked responses; collection size is verified against `meta.total`, descriptions are
  normalized from the listing payload, and direct job URLs are canonicalized.
- Representative Greenhouse validation passed APT Portfolio, Glean, Motive, Qube Research &
  Technologies, and Pure Storage before the full-family run.
- Full Greenhouse validation passed 25/25 companies with 2,268 jobs and zero missing required
  fields. Of those jobs, 2,265 had `first_published`; one job each at AlphaGrep, Graviton Research
  Capital, and SingleStore retained `updated_at` as an explicit fallback for the H5 date-policy
  review.
- The embedded URLs for Databricks and Graviton Research Capital were corrected to their real
  Greenhouse board tokens. Databricks' 877-job, 9.6 MB response and Pure Storage's 354-job response
  both pass the bounded shared client; the tested maximum is now 20 MB.
- Current proposal accounting reconciles 330/330: 267 auto-verified, 0 current access concerns,
  63 conflicts/non-enumerating sources, and 0 pending oversized structured boards.
- Current source families: Ashby 25, Greenhouse 25, Lever 12, Workday 13, Darwinbox 4, Eightfold 3,
  SmartRecruiters 3, Oracle Cloud 2, SuccessFactors 2, Jobvite 1, search-only 236, unresolved 4.
- Registry remains fully disabled and reconciles all IDs, names, priorities, and source ranks.
- Repository validation passes with 143 tests, strict mypy, and Ruff checks after Greenhouse
  validation.

## Unresolved evidence and limitations

- No source currently has observed access-control evidence. Active challenge pages remain guarded,
  and no authentication or access-control bypass was attempted.
- 63 companies have conflicting, third-party, wrong-region, non-enumerating, or otherwise
  insufficient source evidence. They remain in scope and disabled.
- All current Ashby and Greenhouse mappings pass their complete adapter-group validations.
- Three observed Greenhouse jobs use update-date evidence because `first_published` is absent.
  They remain separate; no uncertain-date inclusion policy has been selected before H5.
- 236 records remain `search_only`; 178 are verified official pages needing custom adapters or
  deeper source-family work, and 58 are conflicts.
- No company was approved as blocked or unsupported at H2.

## Resume point

Continue Phase 4 with Lever fixtures and adapter implementation. Validate representative boards
before running all 12 Lever-mapped companies and diagnose the current conflict rather than
silently excluding it.
